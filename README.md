# Celestia Ads: Transforming Digital Advertising with NFTs

## Introduction

- Welcome to Celestia Ads, a groundbreaking project that leverages blockchain and NFT technology to revolutionize digital advertising.
- We present an innovative approach that benefits advertisers, content creators, and consumers.

## Problem Statement

- Traditional Ads: Lack transparency, prone to fraud, and involve multiple intermediaries.
- Centralized Platforms: Control over content, high fees, and limited monetization opportunities for content creators.
- User Engagement: Users often ignore or find ads irrelevant.

## Our Solution

### NFT-Based Advertising Ecosystem

- Smart Contracts: Built on Ethereum, ensuring transparency, security, and trust.
- NFTs as Ads: Each advertisement is represented as a unique NFT, providing authenticity and ownership.
- Token Rewards: Users and referrers earn ART tokens for impressions and clicks, creating an engaged community.

## Key Features

1. NFT Ads Marketplace: A decentralized platform for buying and selling ad spaces using NFTs.
2. Rewards System: Users earn ART tokens for viewing and interacting with ads, fostering engagement.
3. Transparency: Every impression and click is recorded on the blockchain, eliminating ad fraud.
4. Community-Driven: Decisions about the platform's future are made collectively, ensuring fairness.

## How It Works

1. Advertisers mint NFT ads and set rewards in ART tokens.
2. Users and referrers earn ART tokens for impressions and clicks.
3. NFT ads can be traded on the marketplace, creating a secondary market for advertisers.


## Future Roadmap
